Cell Analysis Market Dynamics

DRIVER: Growing number of drug discovery activities

Adoption of cell-based screening assays has increased in he drug discovery activities to understand associated complexities. Additionally, advances in cell biology, bioinformatics, molecular biology, genomics, and proteomics have generated large volumes of data, owing to which the use of cell-based assays in the drug development process has gained importance. Similarly, the Human Genome Project has generated a number of targets on which drug screening experiments can be carried out. This rapid expansion in drug targets and drug leads in recent years has accelerated the development of cell-based assays for primary and secondary screening in drug discovery.

RESTRAINT: High cost of instruments and restrictions on reagent use

The introduction of high-throughput screening (HTS) and high-content screening (HCS) technologies in cell analysis has increased their reliability. However, these technologies have also resulted in a significant increase in the cost of instruments. Moreover, the time and cost involved in each HTS process are directly proportional to the target molecule’s complexity; consequently, the higher the complexity, the greater the cost. In biopharmaceutical companies, the overall cost of production of biopharmaceuticals has increased considerably due to the use of these expensive systems.

OPPORTUNITY: Application of novel cell-based assays in cancer research

In the last few decades, the incidence and prevalence of cancer have increased significantly across the globe, and this trend is expected to continue in the coming years. In an effort to reduce cancer incidence and mortality, the demand for novel approaches that offer effective cancer diagnosis and treatment has increased in recent years. In this regard, some recent studies have been published that highlight the importance of cell-based assays in cancer research.
