Anatomic Pathology Market Dynamics

Drivers: High incidence of cancer and other target diseases

Cancer is the second-leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 10 million deaths in 2020. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths occur due to cancer (Source: World Health Organization). In 2020, 19.3 million new cancer cases were reported, and this figure is expected to increase to 30.2 million by 2040. This increase in the incidence of cancer can be attributed to the growing geriatric as well as the total population. According to the World Population Ageing 2020 report, the global population aged 65 years and above was 727 million in 2020 and is expected to double by 2050 to reach 1.5 billion. Since the elderly are more susceptible to various diseases, this demographic trend is expected to result in a significant growth in the prevalence of several chronic diseases, including cancer, across the globe.

The incidence of cancer is the highest in developed regions; however, cancer mortality is relatively higher in underdeveloped regions due to a lack of access to treatment facilities and the late detection of cancer in several patients. According to the WHO, for many cancers, the incidence rate in countries with high or very high HDI1 is generally 2–3 times that of low- or medium-HDI countries. Approximately 70% of deaths due to cancer were reported in low-income and middle-income countries in 2018.

CHALLENGES: Availability of refurbished products

The availability of refurbished anatomic pathology instruments is a major challenge to the growth of this market. LabX (US), AL-TAR (US), Rankin Biomedical Corporation (US), and Swerdlick Medical Systems (US) are some companies offering refurbished anatomic pathology instruments such as tissue processors, staining systems, and microtomes. A number of end users—mainly small and medium-sized laboratories—look for cost-effectiveness and opt for refurbished systems, particularly in the price-sensitive markets in developing countries. Considering these factors, the demand for refurbished anatomic pathology instruments is expected to increase in the coming years, as these systems offer the same functionalities as new equipment at lower costs. This is expected to hamper the revenue of companies offering branded anatomic pathology instruments in the market.
