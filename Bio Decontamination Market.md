Bio Decontamination Dynamics

DRIVER: Rising growth in pharmaceutical & biotechnology industries

Bio decontamination equipment, services, consumables, and accessories are widely used in pharmaceutical companies, especially in parenteral (injectable) manufacturing. According to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries & Associations (EFPIA), the global pharmaceuticals were USD 1,077,856 in 2020. Furthermore, according to the Pharmaceutical Executive, the top 15 pharmaceutical companies invested USD 133 billion in 2021 in R&D expenditure. With the rising R&D expenditure and the increasing focus on the development of new therapeutic and diagnostic products, the demand for state-of-the-art facilities equipped with modern machines & instruments and a properly decontaminated environment (for efficient & effective research and manufacturing) is expected to increase in the coming years. This is considered a positive indicator for the growth of the market during the forecast period.

CHALLENGE: Variability of pathogen-resistance

The variability of pathogen challenge is an important consideration in the market. Different pathogens have varying levels of resistance, persistence, and susceptibility to decontamination methods. Here are some key factors that contribute to the variability of pathogen challenge in bio decontamination:

Pathogen Types: Different types of pathogens pose varying challenges in terms of their resistance and susceptibility to decontamination. Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and spores all have different characteristics and responses to disinfectants and decontamination methods. For example, spores such as those produced by Clostridium difficile, or Bacillus anthracis can be particularly resistant and challenging to eliminate.

Pathogen Resistance: Pathogens can develop resistance to disinfectants and antimicrobial agents over time. Factors such as genetic mutations, adaptation, or exposure to sublethal doses of disinfectants can contribute to the development of resistance. Some pathogens may have inherent resistance mechanisms that make them more difficult to eradicate.
