Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Treatment Market Dynamics

Driver: increasing prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia

Benign prostatic hyperplasia refers to the nonmalignant growth of prostate tissue and is a frequent cause of lower urinary tract symptoms among men. BPH is considered a normal part of male aging and is hormonally dependent on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production. Approximately 50% of men demonstrate histopathologic benign prostatic hyperplasia by age 60 and 90% by age 85. Approximately 30 million men worldwide and 14 million men in the US are said to have benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms. (Source: WebMD LLC.)

Restraint: Side-effects associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia medications

While drugs and surgery can treat BPH, both methods are associated with significant side effects. Medicines commonly used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia include alpha-blockers, 5-ARIs (5-alpha reductase inhibitors), and other drug classes. Common side effects of alpha-blockers include dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, retrograde ejaculation, and rhinitis. Dizziness and orthostatic hypotension are of increased concern among the elderly, as they can cause significant morbidities such as falls and subsequent injuries.

The nation is seeing a rise in its geriatric population which is more prone to this condition and hence is a highly lucrative market for BPH treatment providers.
