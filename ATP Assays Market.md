ATP Assays Market Dynamics

Driver: Increasing food safety concerns

Technological advancements have supported the food supply to be more distinct than ever before. To ensure best-quality products with lowest health risks, several governments and companies have declared regulations to stipulate tolerable levels of contaminants, residues, and additives in food products. Under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), food processing facilities should have food safety programs in place and collect quantitative data to determine that their cleaning and sanitation programs are working. It lowers the risk of foodborne illnesses, closures, and recalls and can also increase efficiency and decrease costs. According to the WHO, in 2022, unsafe food containing harmful bacteria, viruses, parasites, or chemical substances, resulted in more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhea to cancers. An estimated 600 million (almost 1 in 10 people in the world) fall ill after eating contaminated food, and 420,000 die every year, resulting in the loss of 33 million healthy life years (DALYs).

Restraint: High cost of instruments

Cell biology implies extensive research on the development of new therapies, such as stem cell and gene therapies. The instruments, reagents, and other products associated with these research activities are made to be of high quality to obtain accurate results. In biopharmaceutical companies, the overall cost of production of biopharmaceuticals increases significantly due to the use of expensive systems. The cost of research in cell biology is high because of the need to maintain high-quality standards (use of high-grade, expensive products) and comply with guidelines set up by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, it becomes difficult for small hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, and research & academic laboratories to acquire these instruments owing to budget constraints. In addition, the maintenance costs and several other indirect expenses result in an overall increase in the total cost of ownership of these instruments. This is a major factor limiting the adoption of instruments utilized for ATP assays in both clinical and research applications, especially in emerging markets.
